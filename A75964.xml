         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>AUL</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> may water, but it is God alone which rendreth the increaÅ¿e. The Å¿andy foundation of my building hitherto muÅ¿t be razed, and a firmer timely prepared to erect a new edifice upon. But Å¿eeing my particular ruine (with too many in the like CataÅ¿trophe) cannot, nay, muÅ¿t not (with times variation) be repaired by the ancient and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rules of Law and JuÅ¿tice, which evidently preÅ¿ages an eminent (or imminent) diÅ¿Å¿olution. And therefore beyond the care of theÅ¿e outward Tabernacles, the eternall manÅ¿ion of our Å¿oules Å¿hould be thought upon, by a Å¿ure laying another manner, and more firme foundation; building and erecting Å¿ecurely on that bleÅ¿Å¿ed, and moÅ¿t immoveable Rock, <hi>ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us;</hi> by a daily fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:133741:3"/>and edification of a Theologicall archiete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Faith, Hope, and Charity; which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are not Å¿ingly attained by humane endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alone, but through co-operation of Gods holy Spirit (preventing Grace from divine illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tration perpetually aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting) yet for certain wee may (by induÅ¿try) enlighten and conduct mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Å¿ome Å¿peciall degree or apprehenÅ¿ion of Å¿ome hopefull perfection (beginning at youth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pecially) in the future in one, or all, the chiefe whereof is ChriÅ¿tian charity; alwayes intending the morrall good and benefit of others, with (and Å¿ometimes before) our Å¿elves. Now although my former intendment hath prepared ready for the preÅ¿Å¿e, two tracts of another conÅ¿equence, and more concerning the publique; a taÅ¿te whereof I have lately Å¿et forth in Print, by way of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monÅ¿trance, entituled <hi>Clericus Mercati;</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alÅ¿o likewiÅ¿e ready, for the timely expreÅ¿Å¿ion of Mortification and Repentance. ForaÅ¿much as my unhappy and perfidious yoke-fellowes, and co-partners, both male and female, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly made me (Å¿ome other way not to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) more publique then my Å¿elfe would have it, or deÅ¿ired; and thereafter framed and Å¿uted their intentions and purpoÅ¿es (though not with my conÅ¿ent, as they pretend) quite oppoÅ¿ite to theÅ¿e immaculate times (as Å¿ome too preciÅ¿ely deeme) which need no Repentance now, aÅ¿well as no <hi>Clericus Mercati;</hi> both damned in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as uÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e or fruitleÅ¿Å¿e for Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:133741:3"/>I have therefore laid aÅ¿ide and Å¿uÅ¿pended awhile, both. Tracts and rurall office together, as impertinent, untill the preÅ¿ent times mend or end with me and mine, and Å¿o patiently refer my cauÅ¿e and needleÅ¿Å¿e calling, to the Laws Å¿upreame, at the laÅ¿t and generall ReÅ¿urrection.

            <p>For as much as time and too late experience hath made me Å¿enÅ¿ible of every Å¿illable of this Å¿acred Text, and Å¿ent home to my habitation (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the very doors and poÅ¿ts of my houÅ¿e) a dolefull commentary thereof, yet in pious conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that <hi>SampÅ¿on</hi> (though treacherouÅ¿ly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by <hi>Dalilah</hi>) had Å¿trength enough continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him afterwards, to ruine his enemies by the Å¿ame meanes they inÅ¿nared him; and Å¿urely the promiÅ¿e (through divine ordinance and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) is not by the bondwoman, but the free, as our ApoÅ¿tle alÅ¿o inferreth, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24.
